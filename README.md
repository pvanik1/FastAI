<b>Practice Apparel problem findings</b>
- normalising the images by defaults according to imagenet worsened accuracy
- applying default transforms worsened accuracy as well as training time because the transforms were not relevant to the image set. Even resnet50 had faster training time
- Leaderboard: #50 (11/3/2019) with accuracy 91.1% accuracy https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-identify-the-apparels/lb

<b>Practice Age detection problem findings</b>
- for a regression task, the error_rate and accuracy metrics don't make sense. Those metrics are used for classification tasks e.g. If I classify 6 out of 10 items correctly my accuracy was 60% and error was 40%. For regression, itâ€™s about how close you are to the correct answer and so we use metrics like MAE (mean absolute error) or MSE (mean squared error). To do that, we pass metrics = mean_absolute_error as an argument when creating the learner.
